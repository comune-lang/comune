# The Comune Programming Language

Hi! If you're reading this, you're probably interested in my silly little language known as *Comune*. 

I appreciate that! I don't know how far this project is going to go, but at time of writing, August 4th, 2022, I'm very proud of where we're at. Which is why I'm setting up this book to document the design and feature set of Comune as it develops, and hopefully keep it all straight in my head for a change.

Anyway, this book is intended to be an introduction to the Comune programming language for existing C++ programmers, but aims to generally be friendly and understandable to non-C++ experts as well. Feedback on both this book, as well as the language itself, is highly appreciated!
